# Contribution process  
- Before you start contributing to something, please submit an Issue and describe in detail what you are doing  
  For example: if you want to fix a bug, you need to raise the bug issue first, and then comment that you are working on this, so that we can Assign the task to you.
- When you are contributing, please make sure to follow GuGoTik's original project code style, and complete GoLint operations and single-test operations locally.
- When you have completed your code modification, please submit it to the repository in the form of a PR and mention your Issue for us to track.
